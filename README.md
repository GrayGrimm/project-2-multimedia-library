App Name: Mediaplex: The ultimate multimedia catalog

Getting Started:
I chose do make an app that can store and catalog my movies (which will turn into much more), because I want somewhere I can go and reference all the movies I own. I added functionality for marking if you have watched it to help keep track of those you haven't. Right now you can Create, Read, Update, and Delete movies in your personal database.
